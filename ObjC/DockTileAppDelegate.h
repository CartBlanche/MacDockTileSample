 Abstract: DockTile is a "game" which demonstrates the use of NSDockTile, and more importantly, the NSDockTilePlugIn protocol introduced in 10.6.
 
 The game is terribly simple: Your score goes up by 1 just by launching the app! So keep on launching the app over and over to reach new high scores.
 
 The high score is shown in the dock tile, and the app window, where you can also reset it.
 
 The whole game is implemented in the DockTileAppDelegate class, which is the delegate of the application. On applicationDidFinishLaunching: it updates the highScore. The only other thing it does is to implement resetHighScore: to set it back to 0.
 
 The dock tile plug-in is useful as a way to show off your high score even when the app is not running. The plug-in simply reads the high score from defaults, displays it as a badge on the dock tile, then updates it on receipt of a distributed notification that indicates when the high score changed.
